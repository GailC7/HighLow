Hello,

This is a simple game written in Java where a random number is generated for the computer to guess. At the beginning, the user will see the random number generated to be guessed by the computer. From here, the computer will begin to guess random numbers. If the number is too high, a "too high" statement will be displayed. The computer will guess again with a lower number. If the number is too low, a "too low" statement will be displayed. The computer will guess again with a higher number. The computer will continue to guess under the criteria of too high or too low till the correct number is guessed by the computer. When the correct number is guessed, the screen will prompt to verify the correct number guessed and display the number of attempts the computer took to guess the correct number. The screen will then display the correlated score based on Mr. Kinserâ€™s criteria for expectations.
